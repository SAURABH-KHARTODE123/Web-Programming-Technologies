1.React-->React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components and SPA

2.Advantages of React --->
	i)Modular Library:Helps to develop lightweight specific application 
	ii)Asynchronous library:Uses implicitly ajax so without reloading complete page new datails can be added
	iii)Performance Optimization: React's virtual DOM allows it to efficiently update and render only the parts of the UI that have changed
	iv)Composable:Allows us to combine parts of elements to form a whole.
	v)Wrte once use everywhere:We develop new features without writing existing code.

3)Limitations of React-->
	i)Unstable library
	ii)Dont have control over the applications
	iii)Uni-directional Data Flow

4)JSX
	i)Stands for Javascript xml
	ii)Allows us to write HTML in react
	iii)convert HTML tags into react elements
	iv)Provide ability to create reusable components
	
5)Functional component vs Class component
	i)No render function          | 	Render function present in class component
	ii)State:Functional components cannot have their own state,| but class components can
	iii)Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as input and return JSX as output.
		 class components are JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class
	iv)Stateless  |  Stateful
	v) Accept only props | Accept both props and State

6)Virtual Dom:The Virtual DOM is a programming concept where "virtual", representation of a UI is kept in memory 
	and synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as React. 
	It updates only the changed parts of the actual DOM which leads to efficient and faster operation.

7)React State:In React, state is a special object that allows you to store and manage data in a component. When the state of a component changes,
	 React will automatically re-render the component and update the UI to reflect the new state.
	State is Immutable: we cant change state Directly we have to use setState
eg useState,setState,useEffect,useContext

8)React props
	This is a object that is passed to a component from its parent component.
	React props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from one component to another.
	Props are read-only,
	props are passed to componenets via html attribute

9)Why should extend react component class?
 Because it provide us  access to 
	lifecycle methods 
	state management,
	component specific logic,
	enable modular and reusable code

10)Data Binding	
	Data binding is a mechanism in which a data model is synchronized with the user interface
	React uses ONE way Data Binding-->Change in data automatically update UI but not vice versa

11)Library and Framework
	Framework uses library library not uses framework
	Libraries are target specific functionality while framework tries to provide everything required 
to develop Complete Application.

12)Lifecycle of React component:
	1.Construction -->The constructor is called when a component is first created.
	2. Initialization -->Before the component is mounted, the static method getDerivedStateFromProps is called.
	3. Mounting -->When the component is initially rendered, the render method is called.
  		     This method should return a description of what the component should look like on the screen.
	4. Updating -->When the component's props or state change, the process of initialization and mounting is repeated
	5. Unmounting -->When the component is no longer needed, its componentWillUnmount method is called 
	6. Deletion -->Finally, when the componentWillUnmount method has completed, the component is removed from the DOM and deleted from memory.
